NOTE: THIS IS CURRENTLY STILL UNDER DEVELOPMENT AND IN ITS EARLY STAGES NOTHING IS FINAL AND MANY ITERATIONS ARE TO COME
# Introduction
This is going to be an intelligent robotic arm, kind of like DUM-E from Iron Man. It will be able to detect and identify objects and grab and hand them to the operator at the operator's will and also will include remote control options.
